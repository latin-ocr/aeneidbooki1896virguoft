'l'he obj eet that Vergil had in writing the Aeneid. is object ot
variously stated by writers. Spence, Holdsworth and Warton ΔΕΜ·
say that the poem was written with a political object to re-
concile the Romans to the new order of things. This view is
also held by Pope, who says that the poem had as much a
politica] object as Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel 3 that its
primary object was to praise Augustus, and the secondary
one was to fiatter the Romans by dwelling on the splendour
of their origin. “Augustus is evidently typified under the
character of Aeneas, both are cautious and wise in counsel ;
both are free from the perturbations of passion 3 they were
cold, unfeefing, and uninteresting3 their wisdom and policy
were worldly-minded and calculatin g. Au gustus was conscious
that he was acting a part, as his last words show 3 and the
contrast between the sentiment and conduct of Aeneas, when·
ever the warm impulses of affection might be supposed to
have sway, likewise created an impression of insincerity.
The characteristic virtue which adorus the hero of the Aeneid
as the epithet pius, so constantly applied to him shows, was
filial piety, and there was no virtue which Augustus more
ostentatiously put forward than dutiful affection to Julius

METRE.

The Aeneid is written in the heroic metre of the Romans ;

viz.: the dactylic hexameter, This was the most ancient The dactylic
as well as the most digm'fied form of verse among the Greeks hexameter,

and Romans. It was cultivated at an early period, far
beyond the beginnings of authentic history, as we find it in
its most perfect shape in the poems of Homer and Hesiod,
and the responses of the Delphic oracle. Ennius is said to
have discarded the rude Saturnian metre of his predecessors,
and to have introduced the hexameter among the Romans.
Vergil is generally considered as the model of this kind of
verse among the Latius.
