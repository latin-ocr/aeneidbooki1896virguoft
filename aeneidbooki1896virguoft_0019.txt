3. The Aeneid‚²² in twelve books, written between 29 B,0,— Aeneid.
19 B.G„ recounts the story of the escape of Aeneas from
burning Troy, his wanderings over the deep in search of a
home which the fates had promised, his final settlement in

brought by his detractors, and granting the full indictment
brought against the poem, Vergil still has the proud claim
of being one of the greatest of epic poets. No doubt his

power of invention is less than Homer’s, no doubt he did
