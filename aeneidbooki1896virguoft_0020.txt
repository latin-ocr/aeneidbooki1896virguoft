this, as we have remarked, could hardly be otherwise 111 his

and there is no doubt that his hero Aeneas is cold-blooded

and uninteresting.

&vellendas—These defects, however, are far more than
counterbalanced by his many excellencies. “There is ,111
Vergil a great tenderness of feeling, something better and
more charming than mere Roman virtue or morality. That
110 excels in pathos, as Homer in sublimity, is an old
opinion, and it is surely the right one. This pathos 15 given
at times by a single epithet, by a slight touch, with graceful
art by an indirect allusion 3 this tenderness is more striking as
