50 VERGIL'S AEN. B. 1.

“resounding through their caverns,'’ or “deep sounding.’' The
reference is to Charybdis. The onomatopoeia well imitates the
hissing sound of the seething whirlpool.

201-Accestz·s= accessistis : “ you drew near.'' For similar cases of syncope,
in Vergil: cp. extz‘nxem, extz‘nxtz', traxe, vz'xet.—Cycl0pea saxa,
referring to the cave of Polyphemus. The usual quantity is Cyclo-
pius, not Cyclopffzts: cp. Aen. 3, 569.

203—F0rsan-iuvabit: “this, too, sometime we shall haply remember
with delight ;'' elliptical for fors sit an ; lit., “the chance may be
whether,'' z'.e.‚ “ perhaps.'' See note on forte, v. 151.—olim, here
:aliquando in prose: see note, v. 20.

204—Dz‘scrz'mz'na rerum=res periculosas. —discrz'men ; properly, the turn-

207-Βκναίεετλῆτε : “ bear up.’'——rebus ε dat.

208—Distinguish in meaning vaces, vacem rifert, nffert. Morris renders
this passage ε

So spake his voice, but his sick heart did mighty trouble rack,
As, glad ot countenanee, he thrust the heavy anguish back.

209—Spem simulat vultu: “hope in his look he feigns.”—vultu: abl.
instr. Distinguish simulare, to feign what you are not : dissimulare,
not to shew what you actually are.——premz't—dolorem ε “he holds
hidden deep in his heart his gries.''-·c0rde ε local abl.

210—Se accingunt: 1it., “ gird themselves, '' z'.e., “busy themselves.’'
The toga of the Romans, hanging loose, had to be tucked up sor an

211—Vergil was well versed in the fieremonial rites of the Roman religion.
The minuteness of the description is paralleled by Hom. Il., 1, 458-
473.—coslz's: abl. separation.—viscera‚ properly, the great internal
organs, as the heart, liver, ete.‚ but also applied to the flesh in
general, or to anything beneath the skin.

instr.—trementia, scil„ viscera—figunt:lrarzfigzcrzt.
213—-Aena‚ scil„ vasa: “the bronze pots.'' Vergil is here guilty of an

anachronism, Homer’s heroes knowing nothing of boiled meat.
The hot water may have been for the bath taken before the meal

began.
