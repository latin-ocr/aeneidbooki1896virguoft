504—Instans—futuris: “intent on her work and on the (glory of her)
realrns yet to be.''

505—Forz'bus--tcstudine: local ablatives. Temples, at least among the
Greeks, had generally three distinct parts: (1) the outer court
(vestibulum, πρόναος); (2) the inner court (cella, ναός); (3) the
treasury (thesaurus, θησαυρός). By foribus is meant the doorway of
the cella, or inner court, which here was a vaulted roos (testudo)
resembling a lortoise slzell.

506—Armis=ab armatis viris.—solioque--resedit2 “ and supported from
beneath by a lofty throne, she took her seat.''—solium (rt. SED, to
sit), a high chair of state.-—alte=alto‚ limiting solio, rather than
resedit.

507—Iura—legesque: cf. δίκην, νόμους τιθέναι 2 iura dare was said of a
judge 3 leges dare was said of a lawgiver. Distinguish ius, what is
just and right in itself or what from any cause is binding (iunge)
upon us and lex, the written (lego) statute or order.

508—Operumque—tralzebat: “she adjusted into equal shares the toil of

magno, or (2) abl. of place = in concursu magno.

510—-Addison in Spectator, 273, points out the fact that Vergil is defective
in characterization. Gyas, Mnestheus, Sergestus, and Cloanthus are
all of them men of the same stamp and character ε fortemque Gyan,
fortemque Cloanthum.

512—Penz'tus: ‘⁶ sar away.’'—avexerat: other readings are advexerat,*
averterat.

lage.
