X WORKS OF VERGIL.

Theocritu? the piny woods, the upland lawns and feeding flocks, the sea
ἕέἧξΡΞΞ-ζῖιῗὶ and sky of Sicily. Vergil's Eclogues, on the other hand, can
hardly be said to be true pictures of pastoral life. His shep-
herds and shepherdesses belong to khe island of Sicily rather·

Ciny. The long-continued wars had, however, desolate-d
Italy?1 Even after war had ceased, the soldier, too long
