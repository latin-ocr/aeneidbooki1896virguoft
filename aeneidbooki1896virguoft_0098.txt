gression up to a certain time3 nunc, definitely the present.—saces
el saxa were the arms of a Roman mob, as the carrying of arms was
forbidden within the city.

say that Cicero is meant.—quem: note quis=aliquis aster sz', nisi,
num, ne, quo, quanto. —forte, “perchance,'' takes the indic„ so

thought of 3 hence the plural. The perfect is used to express
momentary action—adstant: “they stand· by.'' Note force of ad.

river or sea deity ; cp. pater Tiberinus (Livy, 2, 10) 3 pater Oceanus
(Verg. Georg. 4, 382) 3 pater Portunus (Verg. Aen., 5, 241). So
