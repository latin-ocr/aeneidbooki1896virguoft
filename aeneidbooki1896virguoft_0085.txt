Nomas. 33

ille: cp. Homeric ὅ γε, not the subject of iactatus (est), but in appo-
sition with quz'.—terrz's—alto.· local amalthea—superam z super-
orum, scil. dem-um.—multa—passus, like iactatus, a participle, lit.
“much, too, having suffered in war also.’⁷—dum—conderet: “in his
attempts to build.⁷' The idea of purpose is implied.—Latio, dat. =
in Latium in prose.

6—Unde=a quo, scil., ortum est: “from whom (sprung).’' Some think
that the three stages of the growth of Rome are referred to, viz.,
the original settlement at Lavinium, the transference os power to
Alba Longa, and the final selection of Rome as the seat of empire.
The Latius dwelt in the broad plain between the Sabine mountains
and the sea, and traced their descent to King Latinus. The word
Latini means the dwellers of the plain: cp. latus, πλατὺς, Eng.
flat; for the loss of the initial mute, cp. lanx, πλάξ ; lavo, πλὺυειν.
Vergil is incorrect in saying that the Latins were descended from
Aeneas, as they existed before his advent: cp. Livy, 1, 1. Their
chief town was Lavinium (now Pratz'ccz).

7—Albanz' patres: Alba Longa was the head of a confederacy of thirty
Latin towns. After its destruction by Tullus Hostilius, the leading
citizens were transferred to Rome, and became incorporated in the
common state. Many of the noble families of Rome, notably the
Iulii, traced their descent to the Albans.—Alba Longa occupied a
site probably near the convent of Palazzuolo.—moenia (rt. MUN, to
desend3 cp. ἀ-μίψ-ειν), the walls for defensive purposes3 murus
(mun-rus, also rt. M UN)‚ a wall of any kind; paries (rt. PAR, to
separate), the partition walls of a house ; maceria, a garden wall.—
allae Romae, “of stately Rome.'' Rome at first occupied the
Palatz'ne. Afterwards the Capitoline, Aventine, Esquiline, Coelian,
Vz'mz'nal, and Quirinal hills were included. Also the Pincian,
Vatz'can, and stmz'culan hills, on the Etruscan side, were brought
within the boundaries of the city under Aurelius.

S—Ilffusa .· Vergil, following the example of Homer, invokes the muse and
refers the whole plot to the gods. Calliope was the muse of epic
poetry.—quo numine laeso: there are several ways of taking these
words ; (1) some supply, impulsus fuerit, “ by what offended deity
was he (Aeneas) constrained ;'' (2) numine:volzcnlate‚ “what
purpose (of Juno) being thwarted ;’' (3) qzcozqua de causa, “sor
what reason, her (zze. Juno's) will being thwarted ;'' (4) ob quam
laesionem numinis, “on account of what affront to her purpose ;''
(5) “for what offence to the majesty of heaven.'’ The last is
