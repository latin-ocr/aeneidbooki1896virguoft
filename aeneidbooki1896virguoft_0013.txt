LIFE OF VERGIL.

Publius Vergilius Maro¹ was born on the fifteenth of Birth-
October, ΒΩ, 70, in the first consulate of M. Licinius Crassus

and On. Pompeius, at Andes (now Ρίεέοῖα), a small village
near Mantua. Since the full franchise was not given to this
part of Gaul (Gallia Transpadana) till some years after-
wards2, the poet, like many of his predecessors and contem-
poraries in literature, was not a Roman, but an Italian
provincial.

The parents of Vergil, like those of Horace, were of His Parents
obscure* birth. Some authorities say that the poet‘s father
was a potter‚ others, that he was a brickmaker, while others
again assert that he was the servant of a travelling merchant,
Magius, whose daughter, Magia Polla, he afterwards married.
Whatever may have been his occupation, certain it is, that
he was at the time of the poet’s birth, the steward, factor, or
possessor of an estate near Mantua. The childhood of
⁵ Vergil was passed amid the hills and woods that fringed the
verdant banks of the Mincius, and the early association of
the poet with the lovely scenery of the neighbourhood of his
native town may account for the exquisite touches of pas·
toral life which appear in the Eelogues and the Georgics.

 

¹ The English equivalent of Vergilius is often spe-lt Virgil. Indeed the poet is best
kuown by the name thus spelt. However, it is better to adopt the spelling that har-
monizes with what is undoubtedly the correct Latin form. The form Virgilius was
not common till the middle ages. Every Roman citizen had regularly three names——
denoting the individual‚ the qens or olan, and the familia. Thus in Publius Veryilius
Maro, Publius is the praenomen, marking the individual ; I'eryilius is the nomen,
denoting the fyens or clan 3 while Maro is the coynmnen, or family name. Sometimes
an aanomen was added ior military distinction, as Asm'canzw to Scipio, Numidicus
to Metellus.
