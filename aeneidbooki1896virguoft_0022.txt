xiv METRE or THE AENEm.

The dactylic hexameter consists, as its name implies, of six

feet, the first four of which may be dactyls or spondees;
the fifth is usually dactyl, and the sixth invariably a
Spondeo. The following is the scheme ε

 

 

 

 

Rules for Quantity.

In scanning, the pupil should understand that his general
knowledge of quantity must be constantly brought into use.
For example, from the outset of his studies he has learnt that
-is of the dat. and abl. plur. is long, and -z's of the gen. sing.
is short. So -α of the nom. is short, and -α of the abl. is
long. He knows also that a vowel before a final tis short.
The following special rules may be helpful; in fact to make
scanning easy they must be continually referred to.

1. A vowel before a vowel in the same word is short.
Exceptions Aeneas and many other proper names, illius, etc.

2. A vowel before two consonants (not a mute and
liquid) is long by position.

3. Before a mute and liquid (e.g., pl. ιν) a vowel is

COffnTlfig-poeflx re· (back or again) and the enclitic -que are

naturally short. They may of course be long by position.

5. Both for quantity and for elision (see sec. 5 below) the
letter h does not count as a consonant. For instance, asin
Ιιῑσ car-[7-1Zsfziltihoc, v. 17, the it is short though coming before
two consonants; and in (ltquoe) hominium, v. 65, e is elided
as before a vowel. In Samo ; hic, v. 16, the pause prevents
the elision of ο.

arrangement is varied to avoid monotony. A succession of
dactyls may be used ior various reasons, e.9.‚ quick motion,

thunder fall in quick succession.
