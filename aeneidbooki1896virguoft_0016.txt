in Rome on the Esquiline, near the residenees of Horace and
Maecenas, estates in Sicily, and in Campania, near Naples.
The mild climate and clear skies of Southern Italy suited his
delicate constitution, and till his death, his Campanian resi-
dence was his favourite abode.⁹ From the date of his early
Eclogues till his death, little need be said of his life except
that he devoted himself to study and to the completion of
his immortal works.

Death and Character.

In the year B,C, 19, he went to Graece, possibly with
a view to restore his health, and to give a finish to his
great work, the Aeneid. At Athens he met Augus-
tus, who had just returned from Samos. Vergil returned
to Italy in company with the emperor, but died at
Brundisium three days after he lauded, 22nd September,
19 B.0. He was buried near Naples on the road leading to
Puteoli (Puzzzwli). His epitaph, said to have been dictated
by himself in his last momente, was as follows :—

Mantua mc yenuz't ‚· Calabri rapuere ; tenet nunc
Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces.10

It is said that shortly before his death Vergil wished tc
destroy the Aeneid rather than leave it in its unfinished state.
His friends however dissuaded him, and the poem was after-
wards edited and published by Varius and Tucca under
the sanction of Augustus and Maecenas.

Vergil is generally described as of tall stature, delicate
frame, homely features, and dark complexion, abstinent iv
the use of food, shy, and fond of retirement. Horace is said
to have had Vergil in his mind's eye when he wrote11 the
lines thus rendered by Conington :

 

8 Horace Satires 1, 5 and 10.
⁹ Geo. lv, 563. Illo Veryilium me tempore dulcis alebat

Parthenope, studiis florentem iynobilis oti.

¹⁰ Some have taken the last line to refer to the Eclogues, the Georgics, and the

Aeneid.
