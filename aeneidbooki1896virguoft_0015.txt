Aequaintance with Augustus and Maecenas.

Unlike Horace, Vergil sympathized with the party of
Caesar. The formation of the Second Triumvirate threw the
Roman world into the broils of a civil war. In the division
of the provinces, the Gauls (except Gallia Narbonensis) fell
to Antony. The lands of eighteen cities were given
up to reward the legions of the unscrupulous Antony‚
