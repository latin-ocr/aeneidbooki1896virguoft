the action of the waves.

312—C0mz'tatus : deponents are sometimes used passively: adeptus, expensus,
pactus, partitus, sortz'tus.—Aclmte: this ablative of agent is rare,
except with the part.—c0milatus ε others explain it in the ablative of
accompaniment with cum omitted: cp. B. IX, 48, vigy'nti lectis
comitatus.

maiden) as the Thracian Harpalyce (is when she) out-tires the
steeds.'' Others take fatigat : “presses sore.'’ The Spartans were
noted for their scanty dress ; the Thracians were famous hunters.

317—Prawertitur Hebrum: “outstrips the Hebrus : ’' the accusative is
sometimes used after verbs that acquire a transitive meaning: cp.
erumpere unbem, v. 580. MSS. all read Hebrum: but as (1) it
is no proof of swistness to outstrip a river in speed and (2) the river
Hebrus is not a swift stream, some of the most critical editors, in-
cluding Ribbeck and Peerlkamp, conjecture Eurum. There is no
need, however, of the conjecture, sor (1) MSS. are unanimous in
reading Hebrum, (2) Sir Walter Scott, Lady of the Lake, 5, 18,

says ι “ Along thy banks, swift Teith, they ride,
And in the raee they moek thy tide. ’¹

(3) Seneca and Plutarch both refer to the Hebrus as a swist river.

stream.
