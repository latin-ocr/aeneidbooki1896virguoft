52 VERGIL'S AEN. B. 1.

23l—Quz'd—orbis z “ what sin so heinous could my Aeneas have committed
against thee, what sin, the Trojans, to whom, after suffering so many
hardships, the whole world is closed on account of Italy? '’ cunctus,
for co-z'unctns or co-vz'nctus.—ob Italiam: to prevent their coming
to Italy.

234—Certe: distinguish certo, a particle of affirmation joined with scio,
“surely,” “certainly,” and certe, which modifies a statement, ‘⁶ at
least,’' joined to any verb. Join with pollicitus, scil.‚ es. —lzz'nc-lzinc
is (1) either a repetition, (2) or, there are two clauses 3 lzt'm· Roma—
nos sore, lzz'nc ductores fore a sanguine T euml—volventibus annis:
cp. Homer's περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν.

236—Qm'—tenere7zt: “shall hold‚’' imperf. subj. of virtual oblique narra-
tion and also because qui is final.—0mnz': abl„ “in universal
sway,’' i.e., with every form of sway, over life, death, property, etc.

Some important MSS. read omnes, agreeing with terras, which is

simpler.

238—H0c: “by this,'' abl. of means3 referring to the promise mentioned
before.

239—Fatz's-—rependensz “ balancing fates by opposing {ates ;'' strictly

Troy is compensated by the hope of reaching Italy.

Ι 240- Tot—actos: “harassed by so many woes.’'

242—Medz'z's——Aclzz'vz's : “ escaping from the midst of the Greeks.'' Sopho-

cles represents Antenor as having escaped by collusion from Troy,

the Greeks having spared his life as he concocted a plan to deliver

Ι Troy into their hands. Some say he survived the fallen city, and
founded there a new kingdom 3 others, that he settled in Libya.

243-l'enetrare : “ coasted along. ”

245—Per ora novem: the Timavus rises about a mile from its mouth at
the head of the Adriatic sea. Between the fountain of the river
and the outlet are several subterranean channels, through which the
salt water of the sea is forced back by a storin, breaking out at the
fountain through seven holes or crevices in the roek‚ and overflowing
the channel of the river.

246—It—proruptum: (1) “the sea comes bursting up3'' (2) “it (the
Timavus) rolls as a dashing sea; (3) “it rolls to break upon the
sea ;'’ proruptum, a supine in this last. The first is the most
natural explanation.—pelag0, “ surge. ''
