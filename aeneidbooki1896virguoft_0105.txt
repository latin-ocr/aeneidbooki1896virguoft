247— T amen z “in spite of all his dangers.'’—-urbem Patavi: the genitive
of equz‘valence in description after such words as oppidum, urbs,
flumen is not found in Terence and Plautus, occurs perhaps but
once in Cicero and seems confined to a few cases of poetry and later
prose. It is possible that Timavus here may be the god of the
stream: cp. B. VIII, 72, tuque, O Tybri tuo genz'lor cum flumine
sancto. In Vergil’s day Patavium (now Padua) was the fourth city
of the empire in wealth, ranking next to Rome, Alexandria, and
Gades (cadiz). TheVeneti, or Heneti, are said to have come from
Paphlagonia to Italy 3 others say they were Kelts.

over.

249—qunc—quz'escz't: “now reposing‚ he rests in peaceful sleep.'’-—c0m-

a body sor burial.

Dez‘z'ndzgetes: Aen. 12, 794: Livy, 1, 12.

253—Hz'c‚ agreeing with the predicate Itonos: “is this the reward shown

254—Oll2·=2·llz·: Vergil, like many other epic poets is fond of archaisms:

so metu=metm', v. 257 3 curru, v. 156.—Subridens: with the force
of sub· cp. that os ὑπο- in ὑπογελᾶν.

255—The majestic spondees give dignity to the look os Jove.

257—Metuzmetuz: —Cjtlze'rffa : adjective sem. ‚ from Cythera ; see note on
Lavini, next line. Venus was so called because she was worshipped
at the Island of Cythera (now Certgo). Her* worship was probably
a remnant of the old Phoenician worship of Astarte, who was after-
wards identified with Venus and Juno.

proper names.
