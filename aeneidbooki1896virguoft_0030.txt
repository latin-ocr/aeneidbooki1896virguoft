STORY OF THE AENEID.

Guided by Achaemenides, Aeneas passes Scylla and Charybdis “

and lands at Drepanum, where Anchises dies. He then starts
out for Italy, but stress 01 weather drives him on the coast
01 Africa, near Karthage. J uno, aware that Rome one day
would conquer her beloved Karthage, had an unrelenting
hatred against Aeneas, and instigated Aeolus to let loose the
winds and wreck the Trojan fleet. Neptune, however, inter-
feres in time and calms the troubled waves. The Trojans find
a sheltered harbour for the seven remaining ships and soon
they land. They afterwards discover that they are on the
coast 01 Africa. <Iuppiter had meanwhile despatched Meroury ¹
to prepare Dido to give a kind welcome to the shipwrecked
followers 01 Aeneas. Surrounded by a cloud, and invisible to
all, Aeneas and Achates go to explore the country. They see
the towers and walls 01 1110 youthful city, and are surprisedto
find their missing comrades holding audience with the queen.
Under the guise 01 Ascanius, Cupid is sent by Venus to kindle
love in the breast 01 Dido. Dido is married to Aeneas.
Other fortunes the fates had in store for him. Mei-cury is
sent to remonstrate with Aeneas. In spite 01 1110 love and
entreaties 01 Dido, the order is given to sail, and once more
the Trojans steer 101 Italy. Dido, through grief for her fiekle
lover, mounts the funeral pile and stabs herself, and. then her
attendants burn her body. He arrives a second time at Dre-
panum, and then for nine days celebrates the funeral games in
honour 01 his dead father, Anchises. While the games were
in progr-effi, some of the Trojan women, despairing of ever
having a settled home, fire the ships. <Iuppiter sends rain
and puts out the fire, but not till after four ships are

destroyed. Aeneas leaves in Sicily all the elderly people and ,

all weary 01 roaming, where they found Segesta. The rest sail
for Italy and land at Cumae. Then he meets the Sibyl, under
whose guidance he descends to the lower world and learns
the full details 01 his future 1110. Latinus, king 01 the land
on which Aeneas landed, had a daughter Lavinia, whose hand
is sought 101· by Turnus, king 01 the Rituli. The Latius
summon allies from all sides to repel the foreigners‚ while
Aeneas obtains the aid 01 Evander, and seeks the assistance
01 1110 Etrurians. While he is absent, the Trojan camp is
attacked without success by Turnus and the Latins. Aeneas
