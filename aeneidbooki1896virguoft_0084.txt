32 VERGIL’S AEN. B. 1.

the pastoral poems called Eclogues, cf. Silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris
avena, Ec. Ι, 2.——egressus silvis means “turning from shepherd life‚'’—
vicina arva refers to his didactic poem on agriculture, the Georgics; vicina,
“neighbouring” suggests the close connection between the two kinds os
poetry.—]uamvz's an adv.‚ “however (greedy).⁷'—gratum opus in apposi-
tion to the clause “coegi ut, etc.''—at nunc horrentia fllarlz's arma, the
closing words Of.the fourth line are to be construed continuously with the
fifth line or v. Ι of the text, horrentia qualifying arma the object of cana.—
The usual text begins abruptly “Arms and the man 1 sing.’' The introduc-
tory lines form a preface tracing the poet's gradual progress from pastoral
and didactic-agricultural poetry to the loftier and grander Epic.

 

l-Arma virumque cano .· “ Ι sing of arms and the man.’⁷ Vergil observes
the custom of epie poets by announcing his subject at the outset.
Cp. the opening lines of the Iliad, Odyssey and Paradise Lost.—
arma may be used here to show the contrast between the subject of
the Aeneid and that of the Georgies (cp. the opening line of Georgic Ι),
in which the theme, viz., the occupations of rustic life, is announced.
-virum, referring to the deeds of Aeneas. Distinguish cliuo and
cdno.—qui—litlora .· “ who of old from the coasts of Troy came, an
exile of fate, to Italy and the shore of Lavinium.'’—primus.· Heyne
and Wagner, finding a difficulty in reconciling the usual meaning of
primus with the statement of Antenor's previous settlement, men-
tioned v. 242, makeprz'mus=0lz‘m, “of old.” Gallia Cisalpina was
not formally included in ltalia Propria till 42 B.C., and possibly was
not considered by Vergil as a part of Italy Proper. Distinguish ora
= ἀκτὴ, the land or district on the sea3 litus z ῥηγμίν, the land
covered by the breakers of the sea ; νίραεόχθη, the bank of a river.

2-Jtaliamzad ltaliam .· Vergil, with many other poets, sometimes omits
prepositions after verbs of motion: cp. Aen. 1, 365, devenere locos;
Shaks. Julius Caesar 1, 2: “ But ere we could arrz‘ve tlze spot pro-
posed.⁷'—-fat0 may be taken (1 ) with proficgus as above, abl. of instr.;
or (2) with venit, abl. manner. In some compound words pro is
short, though it is usually long. -Lavz'naqne .· others read Lavini-
aque. In scansion, if the latter reading is adopted, τ’ is consonantal,

τ’. e. pronounced y.

3-6—Ille—Latz'0: “hard driven on land and on the deep by the violence of
heaven, for cruel Juno's unforgetsul anger, and hard beset in war
also, ere he might found a city and carry his gods into Latium.’'— ,ᾗ
