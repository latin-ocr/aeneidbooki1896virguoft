nxcunsus. 27

7. We are informed by Donatus and Servius that after Vergil's death,
the order was given by Augustus to Tucca and Varius to strike out what-
ever they 'nciyht think ic advisable to strike out, buc not to add anychiny.

8. Donatus tells us that Nisus, the grammarian, used to say that he
had heard “a senioribus'' that Varius had actually struck out these verses.

9. From all those MSS. from which these verses are absent, other
verses undoubtedly written by Vergil (e.9., Aen. 11.‚ 567-588) are absent
also.

10. In Aen. VI1.‚ 37-45‚ there is a distinct reference to a premeditated
division of the Aeneid into two parts, as foreshadowed in the disputed
lines, viz., an Iliad in mmo horrentia Martis Arma, and an Odyssey in
virumque, Trozae qui primus ab oris, etc.

11. As early as the age of Domitian, we find Saleius Bassus figuring
Vergil’s aseent from bucolic to epio poetry under the identical trope
under which it is figured in these verses, viz., that of a rural musieian
issuing forth out of the obscurity of the woods and presenting himself
before the world as a pel-former of the most complicated and difficult
pleces.

12. Priscian, though in his Formula Interrogandi he parses ARMA
VIRUMQUE CANO as first verse of the Aeneid, nevertheless in his Gram-
mar repeatedly recognizes these verses as Vergil⁷s.

13. Two of our greatest English poets (Spenser and Milton) were
unable to find nobler commencement for two of the greatest poems in
the English language, than an imitation of the commencement afforded
by these lines to the Aeneid :

“Lo i 1 the man whose muse whylome did maske,
As time her taught, in lowly shepheard’s weeds,
Am now enforst, a farre unfitter taske,
For trumpets sterne to ehaunge mine oaten reeds,
And sing of knights’, and ladies' gentle deeds.''
· Srnnsnss, Faerie Queam, L, 1.

“I who erewhile the happy garden sung
By one man's disobedience lost, now sing
Recovered paradise to all mankind
By one man's firm obedience fully tried
Through all temptation, and the temptet·
Foiled in all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,
And Eden raised in the waste wilderness.”
Murro& Paradise Reyained, 1., 1.
