Palatine Library at Heidelberg on its capture by the Bavarians in 1622 3
probably of the 4th century.

4. ‘Roman,’ R,; in the Vatican Library. The character (large capi-
tals: see faesimfle, which is reduced one half from the original size)
resembles that found on the walls of Pompeii, and inscriptions of the ,
lst and 2nd centuries3 but it is probably of the 4th or 5th century.
The great critic Ribbeck ranks R. as the least reliable of the four, and
justly so, as may be judged from the palpable errors in the passage con-
tained in the facsimile.

After these came the countless small letter MSS. of the Sth and 9th
centuries, based upon the great four.

The period of scientific criticism, of printed editions and elaborate
commentary, dates from the Revival of Learning in the l5th century.
The most noted editors of modern times are Heyne, WVagner, Fmbiger,
Conington, N ettleship, Ribbeck and Dr. Henry. The last named was
an indefatigable Irish physician, who spent several years 011 the con-
· tinent consulting and comparing MSS„ in which work he was ably
assisted by his daughter. He has left two monumental works entitled
‘Aeneidea' and ‘Twelve Years' Voyage of Discovery in the First Six
Books of the Aeneis.’ The other commentators are frequently re-
ferred to.

The best English poetical translations of Vergil are those by Ooning-
ton and by Bowen, and the best prose versions are by Mackail‚ and by
Lonsdale and Lee.
