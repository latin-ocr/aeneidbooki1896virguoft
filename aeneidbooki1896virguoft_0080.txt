13. (Henry's chief argument) z

The beginning ARMA vanMQUE cmo would have been essentially
and in itself a bad beginning) ; bad as being

(1) brusque, abr-apt, tzaryid, and devoid of the “molle alque „facetum”
so characteristic of Vergil's style,

(22) ambiyztous, a conflict arising between the interpretation “the
warrior Aeneas,'' and “ che wars (of Aeneas) and Aeneas (him-

self) .''

In rejecting the argument based upon Homer, Henry says, “Very
well, if the more ancient and ruder poem is to be, in all respects, the
model of the more modern and highly finished3 very well, if there are
no excellencies in Vergil which we look in vain for in Homer; very well,
if the argument is used in its full strength, and we begin the Aeneid,
neither with ILLE EGO, nor with ARMA ViRUMQUE CANo, but with MUSA,
mm CAUSAS MEMORA. Then indeed we shall have the Aeneid modelled
on (not an improvement of) the Iliad and Odyssey, the whole three
poems shall begin alike with the invocation of the Muse. . . .'' If,
however, my reader scruples, as no doubt he scruples, to go so far 3 if he
insists, as no doubt he insists, on retaining ARMA VIRUMQUE οΛΝο,
though without parallel either in the Iliad or Odyssey‚ with what vis
consequentiae does he insist on rejecting ‘ ‘1LLE—MARTIS,'’ the explanation
and complement of CANO, on the ground that there is no parallel for it

either in the Iliad or the Odyssey?

Of the quotations from subsequent writers pointing to “ARMA
VIRUMQUE CANO’' as the beginning, Henry says, “the very utmost
shown by those quotations or that can be shown by any number of such
quotations, is the existence from the earliest times, perhaps even from
the date of the author's death, of an Aeneid without the introductory
verses, a fact undisputed, nay affirmed and maintained even by those
who no less affirm and maintain that the Aeneid did not so come into
the world from the creative hand of its author and parent, but only
from the mutilating hands of its godfathers, and that <zo-existent with
such mutilated Aeneid but—partly on account of imperial influence‚
partly on account of the invariable predominance of coarse taste over
refined—far less in vogue, there was always the Aeneid as it came from

the hand of Vergil. ’'
