HISTORY OF VERGIL'S TEXT. XXiX

the poet’s death the Aeneid was a school text-book, thumbed and conned
by Roman boys and expounded by Roman schoohnasters.

A glauce at the facsimile on page xxxi will give the pupil some idea
of those early characters which were the only means of reproducing the
writings of Vergil. then he ‘hears of corrupt passages and. disputed
readings, let him bear in mind that the first copies were made by hand
and with great labour, by persons who perhaps did not in all cases under-
stand what they were copying3 that there were countless chances of
mistaking Vergil's own handwriting in the first place3 and that as the
centuries of copying went on these chauces increased greatly. It is not
strange that Vergil's own handwriting has not come down to us, when
we remember that none of the many copies made during the first three
or four centuries are extant. In having one as early as the 4th or 5th
century we are fortunate, for in the case of many other Latin writers
we have nothing earlier than the Sth or 9th century.

An this time, however, Vergil was being read, studied and annotated.
We hear of one commentator who said that he had seen a man who
had once seen a genuine piece of Vergil's own handwriting. Servius
made profuse annotations in the third or fourth century. Other gram-
marians of that age quoted whole lines from Vergil to illustrate their
expositions of syntax, so that even from these quotations an almost
complete text could be built up.

But the ground-work of all modern text criticisms is to be found in
four great MSS. of the 4th and 5th centuries. These, verified by the
earlier grammarians, who must have quoted from independent sources,
are in all disputes the ultimate court of appeal. But even these are not
conclusive, for the grammarians supply readings that are to be found in

, 110110 of them. It is altogether likely that the four great MSS. were all

based on one common “Archetype'' or original copy, and that what-
ever mistakes this copy contained have been perpetuated as the genuine
text of Vergil. Hence editors can with inmunity go 011 “ conjecturing ⁷'
and “ emending ’' for all time.

The four great MSS. are ;

1. ‘Vatican‚' usually designated by critics F, ; at present to be
seen in the Vatiean Library at Rome ; probably of the 4th century.

¹ 2. ‘ Medicean‚' M, 3 in the Laurentian Library at Florence ; probably
of the 5th century.
