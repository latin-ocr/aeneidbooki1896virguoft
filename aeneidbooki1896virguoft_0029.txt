Menelaus, to recover his wife and punish the Trojans for har-
boring her, assembled a large army of Greeks, led by various
petty Grecian kings and commanded by Menelaus' brother
Agamemnon, king of Argos and Mycenae. This army laid siege
to Troy. After the siege had lasted ten years, by the stratagem
of a huge wooden horse filled with soldiery the city was cap-
tured and burnt, and all but a remnant of the inhabitants put
ι to the sword. This remnant scattered to different localities
around the coast of the Mediterranean. According to the
'Roman legend, Aeneas, led. by the Fates, conducted a party of
Trojans to the west coast of Italy and there founded the
colony from which afterwards grew the “ Eternal City,”
Rome.
