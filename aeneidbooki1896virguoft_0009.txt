PREFACE.

ΙΤ IS hoped that the present edition will fulfil the dual object
of the editors, namely: first, to assist the pupil to study with
intelligence and appreciation the text prescribed for examination,
and secondly, to arouse an interest in, and a taste for, Classical
literature. While it is the duty of an examiner to ascertain whether
the student understands the text prescribed, it ought to be the duty
of the intelligent teacher to see that the student appreciates the

work he is reading.
The editors have sought to aid the teacher in his work by

furnishing the materials in an attractive form.
