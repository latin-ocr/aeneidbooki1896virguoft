EXCURSUS. 29

The effect of a closer study of the question is undoubtedly in the
direction of dispelling the idea that MSS. and learned editors are in all
cases to be relied upon, and of creating the impression that the taste
(questionable taste at the best) of Varius and Tucca, coupled with a
desire to carry out the instructions of their lord and master Augustus,
is to blame for the long chain of error, if error there has been, on the
part of MSS„ quoting authors and critical editors alike.

On the whole, therefore, it seems safer to prefix the disputed words
than to omit them.

Summary.

The question may be summed up as follows :—-

The words ILLE Eoo—MAR'HS are found in some old MSS„ though not
in the oldest extant3 they are treated by Servius and Priscian, early
commentators, as authenti03 it is known that Varius and Tucca had
instructions to omit but not to ad‹l; no explanation of their composition
by a hand other than Vergil’s has been offered: that is to say, “ if Vergil
did not write them, who did?'’; the oldest MSS. extant (4th and 5th
century) omit the lines, but these MSS. are no doubt based upon the
current and official version published and circulated under imperial
authority 3 the testimony of critical editors who base their textual deci-
sions on a mechanical² not a literary, examination of MSS. is worthless
if the MSS. themselves are worthless ς likewise the evidence of quota-
tions, based upon an inaccurate though current version3 the fact that
the majority follow the edited and expurgated version is natural3 the
very existence of the disputed preface is, in view of the circumstances,
strong proof of its own authenticity, pointing as it does to an obscure
though original version, frowned down by imperial disfavour ; the argu-
ment based upon taste and imitation of Homer is weak at the best and,
in fact, may be turned against the inventors of the argument: tastes
differ, and Vergil did not always imitate Homer3 he was more likely
to imitate himself, vide references to parallelisms in the Eclogues and
Georgica.
