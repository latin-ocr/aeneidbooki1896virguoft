THE TROJAN WAR.

So also in B. 1, 448 :
A—er‘e‘cil cv'ci gyrdclllbz'cs ,ςᾱνΙρέὒᾶηί {nminat nexatque
A—em? trabes.
In these lines the final vowel in -qne is struck out before
the initial vowel in the first word of the succeeding line.

There are altogether twenty-one hypermetrical lines in
Vergil.

(e) Ictus is the beat of the foot which corresponds with the
elevation of the voice (ἄρσις). This naturally falls on the first
syllable of the foot, and we, therefore, find cases occurring in
which a syllable naturally short is lengthened, simply from
its occupying the natural position of a long syllable.

THE TROJAN WAR.

Like Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, the Aeneid is based upon
events cupposed to have happened in that legendary aud
romantio episode known as the Trojan War. These events,
as depicted in literature, are almost entirely poetic and not in
the striot sense historical. The legend is that once there was
awealthy and powerful city named Ilium or Troja 011 the
coast of Asia Minor. In a contest between the three goddesses,
Venus, J uno aud Minerva, for the Apple of Discord, Venus
was awarded the prize by the young Trojan prince Paris (or
Alexander), son of King Priam. Paris, who at the time was
being brought up as a shepherd boy on Mt. Ida and had been
chosen judge for the contest, was bribed by Venus with the
promise that she would give him the most beautiful woman in
the world for wife. This woman proved to be Helen, wife of
Menelaus, king of Sparta.
