393—Venus here gives tidings of the missing ships from the omen of the
swans, her favourite birds. There are twelve swans as there were
twelve missing ships. Some of those swans have already settled on the
ground (terras capere), others are on the point of settling on the land
already occupied (captas despectare) ε so the ships either now occupy
the haven (portum tenet) or are entering it (subit) with lull sail.—

been by the storm) ; they have now united, and with whizzing wings
and song they descend to earth. It appears that these words should
naturally come after caela-alis: distinguish ala, a wing ε pinna,
the larger and harder seathers of the wing ; pluma, the smaller and
soster feathers of the body.—-cz·nxere—dedere: the perfects express
