NOTES. 67

456—Ex ordine: cp. ἑξείης-ε “in detail :'' join this with pugnas. The
question has been raised by Heyne‚ whether the poet meant to
represent these battles as depicted in sculpture or in painting. The
latter mode of representation would be more consistent with the
custom of Vergil's own age. The poet ascribes here to the Phoeni-
cians the practice of the Greeks and Romans of his own time.

457—Iam ε “ by this time.’'
459—Saevum z in refraining from the war and in killing Hector.

460—Noslri—laborz's τ “ of our sorrows.''

461-En Priamus. The ransom of the body of Hector by Priam was a
favourite subject among ancient artists (v. 484).—sunt—laudi z
“ here, too, has worth its own reward.³'

462—Sunt——rerum ι “(here) there are tears sor woes.''

463—Feret—salutem ι “the fame of this will bring thee sure deliverance.’'
—fama, scil. Troiae.

464—Inanz' z because the persons represented are now lost. Painting was
unknown at the time of the Trojan war. ,

466-Ναηιᾳιιε-ἱιιυεᾶιίτιςε “for he saw, how warring round the Trojan
citadel here the Greeks fied, (how) the men of Troy pressed in their
rear.''—ulz'= quo modo: see for the mood of ficgerent: impulerit
v. 11.—-Pergama circum : anastrophe. With Pergama: cp. ety-
mologically πίνργος, “a citadel‚’' German burg, “a town ;'’ berg,
“ a hill ; '’ Eng. ·b0r0, -burglz, -bury ε cf. Edin-burg, Edmunds-bury,
Peter-bore.

467—Hac, scil„ parte: “in this quarter.'’

468——Curru instaret: “pursued them with his car :'' curru ,· abl. of
means: with cristatus: cf. Homeric κορυθαίολος, ἱππόκομος.

469-Νίυείς velis ε “ with canvas white as snow ε ” an anachronism, as the
Homeric tents (κλισίαι) were planks thatched with grass. The story
of Rhesus is told by Homer (ΙΙ. 10, 474). Rhesus came from
Thrace, as an ally of Priam, with the oracular promise that should
his steeds drink of the waters of the Xanthus, Troy would be im-
pregnable. Rhesus pitched his tent near the shore, was slain by
Diomede and Ulysses‚ his horses were captured, and thus the sate of
Troy was foreshadowed.

470—Pr2'mo somno: either abl. (1) os time: “in their first sleep‚'' i.e., in
their deepest sleep, or (2) of instrument after prodz'la z “betrayed to
him by their first sleep.'’
