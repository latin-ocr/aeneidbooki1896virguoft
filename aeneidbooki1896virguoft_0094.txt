Aeneas himself is called saevus in Aen. 12, 107.—Aeacides: §Achilles

is meant, who was son of Peleus and grandson of Aeacus. Some

109—Saxa—aras. The order is scara qqae mediis in fluctibus (exstantia)
Itali vocant Aras : “ rocks which (standing out) in the midst of the
billows the Italians call Altars.” The saxa referred to are probably
the rocks just outside the bay of Karthage. Of these, the insula
Aeglmurz' is the chief. Some say the Karthaginian priests used to
offer sacrifices there to avert shipwrecks on the rocks, hence the
term Ara. Others say the Skerkz' rocks are alluded to, situated in

the shallow between Tunis and Sicily.
