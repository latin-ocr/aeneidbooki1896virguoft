In (1) the vowel -e in Eme is elided, i.e.‚ left out in scansion
before the vowel ο- in the next word ora.

In (2) the diphthong -ae in praedae is elided before accinyunt.

In (3) the -um is elided before the interea.

sible. In the second example considerable license is admitted
in the case of a proper noun.
