So in B. 1,150:'
Iamque ῘᾶσΙὲδ &tl 302ch υόΙῖᾶηέ ῙᾶνόνΙᾶνπιᾶ υιὶηΙῑεενᾱί.·
where the quick succession of brands and stones follows.

On the other hand a. succession of spondees may be em-
ployed bo describe a laboured effort ε cp. B. Ι, 118.

ᾹάΙΡανΙὲητ νᾶΙνῖ ηᾶηίΙὲ8 ῑηΙ ,sar-qne! τᾶείῦ.

Here the slow spondees mark the sfiruggling rmotions of the
crew amid the waves.

So also a dignified gaii: may be imitated by successive
spondees: B. 1, 46.

(Note the absence of elision in Dardanio.)

3. When the last syllable of a word remains over, after the ποτα
completion of a foot, that syllable is called a caesural syllable, caesum·
in consequence of ibs being separated, or cut off, as it were, from
the rest of the word in scanning the verse. The term

caesuram is also applied to a pause or stress of the voice,
which naturally rests on ‘che eaesural syllable. The melody Verse

of the verse depends in a great measure on the position of camma
the caesura. The chief verse caesuras in the dactylic hexa-
meter are·

(a) Penthemimeral²⁷ Caesam al: the end of the first syllable sszvrzglzemi
⁸ of thethird foot: B. 1, 621. caesura.

'-'⁵In V ergil we have 28 spondaic lines: 17 οἱ these end in a quadr1s3 llable 9 in a
trisyllable, 2· 1n a monosy llable.

²⁵ Called b3 the Greeks τομή, α cutting.
²⁷From πέντε, five; ἦμι, half; μέρος, α part, or scot: hence the fifth-hall-soot

¹ caesura. This is also called the stt-0129 or masculine caesura.

²⁸ From ἔπτα, seven ; ἧμι, ham· μέρος, a μανι or sooc; hence the seventh-hals-foot
caesura.
