LIFE OF VERGIL.

Studies and Early Life.

Vergil began his studies at Cremona, where, we are told,
he assumed the toycz virilis on the same day on which
Lucretius died. The town itself had already been noted,
having been the birthplace of Furius Bibaculus, and of the
critic, Quinctilius Varro.

After a brief stay at Cremona, and subsequently at M edio-
lanum (Milan), the poet went to Rome. In the capital,
Vergil, after the fashion of the day, attended the lectures of
rhetoricians and philosophers. Under Epidius, the rhetorician‚
the teacher of Marc Antony and afterwards of Octavius, and
under the Epicurean philosopher, Siron, the poet became
acquainted with the outlines of rhetoric and philosophy. It
is quite probable that his father intended him for the bar, bnt
a weak voice and a diffident manner were insuperable barriern
in the way of obtaining distinction in public speaking. Vergil
soon gave up rhetorio, and, in fact, renounced poetry for the
more congenial study of philosophy. Under Siron, he seems
to have made considerable progress in Epicurean philosophy,
and the love he retained for this branch of learning is plainly
observable in many of his extant writings.4 In a minor poem,
generally supposed to be genuine, he welootnes the exchange
of poetry and rhetoric for more useful studies ε

“Away with you, empty coloured flagons of the rhetori-
cians, words swollen, but not with the dews of Greece 3 and,
away with you, Stilo, Tagitius, and Varro, you, nation of
pedants, soaking with fat ; you, empty cymbals of the class-
room. Farewell, too, Sabinus, friend of all my friends: now,
farewell, all my beautiful companions, we are setting our sails
for a haven of bliss, going to hear the learned words of the
great Siron, and we mean to redeem our life from all distrac-
tion. Farewell, too, sweet Muses3 for, to tell the truth, I

have found how sweet you were: and yet, I pray you, look
on my pages again, but with modesty and at rare intervals.'' 5

After a short stay at Rome Vergil probably went to Naples,
where, we are told, Parthenius, another Epicurean, was his
instructor. The great Epic⁶ of Lucretius, added to the
