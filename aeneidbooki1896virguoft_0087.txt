17—Currus .· Juno is rarely represented as a war goddess, though we have
some instances: cp. Hom. Il. 5, 720-3.—lzoc—f0vetque: “the god-
dess even now strives, and fondly hopes that this may be the seat
of empire for the nations, isin any way the sates permit.'’—lzoc is
attracted to the gender os the predicate—sinant: subj. of inter-
mediate clause in virtual oblique narration.—z‘anz tum--etz'am tum .·
“ even then,'' at that early period.

18—Sea' enim: “yet indeed‚’' “however.'' This is usually explained by
an ellipsis (cp. ἀλλὰ γάρ) for sed (metuit Kzrtlzaginz‘) enim, etc„
“ yet (she feared for Karthage) sor she had heard a race was issuing
from the blood of Troy. '’——ducz' .· present as now in the act of being
accomplished.

20- Tyrias—arces.- “which should hereaster overthrow her Tyrian towers.''
The destruction of Karthage (146 B.C.) is referred to. —ver‘teae-et:
everteret: subj. of purpose.—0lz'm may refer to either the past or
future 3 here it refers to the latter : properly (sr. ollus, ille), ‘⁶ at that
time.'’

2l—Hinc=a qua progenie.—late regem=(by enallage) late regnantem:
cp. the Homeric &mmmmm—belloque superbum: “tyrannous in
war.”

22—Excz'dz'0 Libyae .· “to destroy Libyae;'’ for the two datives see F.
134, 1; P. ΙΙ, 101. Some read exscidit), but excidio is not for
exscidia, but for 25-scz'dz'o (ec, sc2'71d0): cp. the forms ecfert), ecfari,
ecsodzb, found in old writers—volvere Parcas, scil. audierat : there is
reference here to the thread of destiny. The Parcae (rt. PAR, “to
allot:'' cp. pars, partio, ἑ-πορ-ον) were the goddesses of birth and
death: three in number, Nona, Decuma, Morta, and so the
arbiters of human destiny. They were identified with the Greek
Μοῖραι (μείρομαι, to allot)‚ Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, whose
duties are included in the foll. line 2-Cl0tlzo colum retinet, Lachesis
net, et Atropos occat: cp. Milton's Lycidas—

“ Comes the blind Fui-y with the abhorred shears,
And slits the thin-spun life.’'

23—Metuens: “fearful of that ;’' metuere, to dread with anxiety some
future evil ς timere, to sear an -impending danger ; vereri, a respect-
sul sear of some superior being ; formidare, to dread——veteris belli:
the war against Troy—Saturnia, scil. filia, or dea, according to
the Greek theogony. Here (Juno) was the daughter of Kronos
who was identified by the Romans with Saturn. The Romans,
however, represent no relationship between Juno and Saturn.
