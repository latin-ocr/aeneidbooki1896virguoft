EXCURSUS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ OPENING LINES OF
THE AENEID.

Most modern editions follow MS. authority in rejecting these lines, but
as the editors of the present edition have ventured to recognize them as
authentic, a full discussion of the ‘question is appropriate. In present-
ing the reasons for rejecting, Mr. Page remarks as follows ε·-

“ The following lines are sometimes placed at the commencement of
the Aeneid,

Ille eqo, qui quondam yracilz‘ modulatus avena
carmen, el eyressus silvis vicina coeyi

ut quamvis avido parerent arra colono,

yratam opus agyricolt's; αι nunc horrentia Alsartis

‘I am that (hard) who once tuned his lay (i.e., the Eclogues) on a
slender straw, and then quitting the woods compelled the neighbouring
ploughlands to answer the demands of the tiller however grasping, a
work dear to husbandmen (i.e., and who subsequently wrote the
Georgics) 3 but now of war's bristling arms I sing. . . .'

The lines however are to be rejected for many reasons :

(l) They are not in any good MSS„ but are first mentioned by
Suetonius.

(2) Arma virumque are quoted as the first words of the Aeneid by
Ovid (Tr. 2. 533), Martial (S. 56. 19), and Persius (1. 96).

(3) The commencement arma. . . ‚is an imitation of the first line of
the Iliad μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, ....and that of the Odyssey‚ ἀνδρα
μοι, ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα. . . .

(4) That a summary of the poet's history should be introduced in
the same opening sentence with a summary of the hero's history

is extremely harsh. Moreover, the sentence becomes very long
and ugly ; the omission too of sum twice over in the first line is

very objectionable.

Milton thought the lines genuine and has imitated them at the com-
mencemcnt of Paradise Regained, but his taste when he imitates
classica] models is not always sound, and the truer ring of Paradise

Lost, l. l should rather be compared.”
