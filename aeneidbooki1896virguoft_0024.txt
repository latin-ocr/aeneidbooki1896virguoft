‘laura' foot when this foot is a dactyl and ends the word: B. Ι, 154.

It may be observed, generally, that 3 verse may have one,
two, or three caesuras3 that verse, however, is best divided

in which the sense pause and the caesural pause coincide as in
each case given above.

ἶλαῗὲθῒὶῗζγᾶ 4. The last word in a dactylic hexameter line is for the
w ιη’ most part 3, dissyllable,³1 or a trisyllable. A quaslrisyllable
is rarely allowed, except in the case of a proper name. Some-
times, but rarely, a monosyllable is employed at the end of a
line, and generally in the case of est, and then usually with an

elision: Β. 1, 105.

{zzz-ZZ- (a) Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or diph-

thong, or with the letter, -m preceded by a vowel and the
following word begins with a vowel, diphthong, or the letter h.
When such is the case, the last syllable of the word so ending
with a vowel, diphthong, or the letter -m preceded by a vowel
is elided, ie, struck out together, and in scansion is not
regarded as a part of the verse, &aq-2
