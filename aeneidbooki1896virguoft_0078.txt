26 EXCURSUS.

The opposite contention is that the lines were written by Vergil, but
were expunged after his death by his editors Varius and Tucca under
orders from Augustus, and that thus the mutilated text became the
current and officially authorized one, furnishing ample ground for the
error of all the ‘⁴ g00d” MSS, the earliest of which belong to the 4th
century and allos which are obviously based on one archetype 3 see p.
xxix, Introduction.

Granted that the common source of all our best MSS. was tainted,
then the MSS. themselves must have been tainted, and the argument
based on these MSS„ as well as on the subsequent tendency of a great
number of editors to follow them, becomes valueless.

The following is a summary of M r. Henry's admirable dissertation on
the subject :—

“ILLE—MART1S ’⁷ INSERTED in 18 out of 50 second class MSS. ; quoted
by Servius, who says they were omitted, obviously “ut causa operis
obtineret principizcm” (“that the subject of the poem might hold first
place'’); accepted by ‘20 important editors, including N. Heinsius
(1670) and Wagner (1832). ³

OMITTmD or srioMATIZED by 2 first-class MSS. (Rom. and Med.), 32
out of 50 second class MSS. and 19 important editors, including
N. Heinsius (1704), Peerlkamp, Ladewig, Ribbeck, Conington.

Arguments in Pavour of Accepting ⁴‘ Ille—Martis.”

1. Their intrinsic merit,—modesly, simplicity, purity (“vim et eleyan·
tiamss' Wagner, 1832).

2. They do not contain a single word unworthy of Vergil (WVagner,
1832).

3. No other plausible origin than Vergil's own hand has been assigned
to them.

4. The turn of thought, the studied comparison of his present subject
with a former subject of his own, or even with other subjects of other

writers, is quite in accord with Vergil's habit.

5. Striking parallels of diction : compare with Ecl. Ι., 2. Ecl. X„ 50.
Geo. L, 99. Geo. Ι., 47. Geo. Ι., 41. Aen. XII„ 124.

6. It is a much easier and safer task to strike out a passage than to
add or prefix one, especially one which would fit so well.
