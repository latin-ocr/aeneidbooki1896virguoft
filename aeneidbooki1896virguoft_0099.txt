secessu longo: “in a deep receding bay.'' Conington finely renders
these lines :-—-

Deep in a bay an island makes
A haven by its jutting sides,
Wherein each wave from Ocean breaks,
And, parting, into hollows glides.
High o’er the cove vast rocks extend,
A beetling cliff at either end ;
Beneath their summits far and wide,
In sheltered silence sleeps the tide,
While quivering forests crown the soene—
A theatre of glancing green.
