ΗΒΕ OF VERGIL. ix

“ The man is passionate, perhaps misplaced
In social circles of fastidious taste ;
His ill-trimmed beard, his dress of unoouth style,
His shoes ill-fitting, may provoke a smile ;
But he’s the soul of virtue ; but he's kind
But that eoarse body hides a mighty mind.”

He was so pure and chaste that the Neapolitans gave him
the name of Parthenias, or the maiden.¹² He is said to
have been shy and even awkward in society, and these traits
even the polished society of the Capital never succeeded in
eradicating. He was distrustful of his own powerS, which
his high ideas of literary excellence led him to underrate.

In the midst of au irreligious age, he had the strongest reli-
gious sentiment3 in the midst of vice he remained virtuous 3
and. while licentiousness disfigures the writings of many of his
brother poets, the pages of Vergil everywhere inculcate the
highest truths of morality and virtue.

Works.

Vergil is said to have attempted in his youth an epio poem¹3 Early worlcs
on the wars of Rome, but the difficulty of the task soon led
him to abandon his design. His earlier poems, Oula, More-
tum, Ciris, Oopa, and those that pass under the name Cata-
lepta, though they give little proof of great ability, still show
the careful attention the poet bestowed on metre and diction.

Vergil were the Eclogues‚¹4 pastoral poems, ten in number,

written between 43 B,G‚—37 ΒΩ. This class of poetry was Eclosyues.

“These were called by the generie term Bucolica (βουκολικά, scil. ποιήματα, from
βουκολέω, to attend cattle). The term Ecloyue is from the Greek ἐκλογή, α choica col-
lection, and may mean that the poenis under that name were a collection from a large
number. Spenser wrote the word *Egyloyue and followed the derivation of Petraroh,
αἰγῶν λόγοι, “tales ofJoats '’ or “ tales ofyoatherd8.''
